## Overview

Welcome to **fsociety**, an all-in-one ethical hacking toolkit. This toolkit is designed to provide a comprehensive suite of tools for ethical hackers, security researchers, and cybersecurity enthusiasts.

## As Seen in Mr. Robot

Our toolkit has been inspired by the critically acclaimed TV series, **Mr. Robot**. The protagonist, Elliot Alderson, a cybersecurity engineer and vigilante hacker, uses a similar tool to bring down the conglomerate, Evil Corp.

By using fsociety, you're following in the footsteps of Elliot, using the same caliber of tools that he used in his crusade against corporate corruption. 

<b> <u> Read before proceeding </u> - We strictly forbid the use of this tool for illegal activities. To be used strictly for research purposes. </b>
